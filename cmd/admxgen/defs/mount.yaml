  explaintext: |
    Define network shares that will be mounted for the client.
    If more shares are defined higher in other GPO, the entries listed here will be appended to the list and duplicates will be removed.

    Values should be in the format: 
            protocol://<hostname-or-ip>/shared-dir
            nfs://example_nfs.com/nfs_shared_dir
            smb://example_smb.com/smb_shared_dir
            ftp://example_ftp.com/ftp_shared_dir
    
    And anonymous mounts should have a prefix tag [anonymous] to indicate them, e.g:
            [anonymous]protocol://<hostname-or-ip>/shared-dir

    The supported protocols are the same as the ones supported by gvfs.
    They are listed on the man page of gvfs, under the gvfs-backends section: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man7/gvfs.7.html
    
    If an entry is not formatted accordingly, it will be ignored or an error may occur.
