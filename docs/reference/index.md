# Technical Reference

This section consolidates technical details on ADSys, including specifications, APIs, and architecture.

On the linux side, ADSys is composed of a daemon and a command line interface:

* The daemon - `adsysd` - implements the Group Policy protocol. It relies on Kerberos, Samba and LDAP for authentication and policy retrieval.
* The command line interface - `adsysctl` - controls the daemon and reports its status.

A Windows daemon, `adwatchd` can be installed on the domain controller to automatically refresh assets without system administrator interventions.
