# ADSys

ADSys is the Active Directory Group Policy client for Ubuntu.

ADSys enables system administrators to manage Ubuntu Desktop clients centrally via Microsoft Active Directory. It includes ADMX and ADML templates and allows policies to be applied at boot and login, then refreshed periodically.

It simplifies the task of configuring Ubuntu systems in a Microsoft Active Directory environment. However, it doesn't handle user authentication or initial security policy, which are managed by SSSD/Winbind and PAM.

ADSys is valuable for system administrators who wish to manage Ubuntu Desktop clients in a centralized manner through Microsoft Active Directory.
